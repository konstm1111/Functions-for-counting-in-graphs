# Functions-for-counting-in-graphs

It`s code for solve problems with graphs.

quang() - the function prints the number of edges in the complete graph (you enter the number of vertices)

quandig() - the function prints the number of edges in a complete bipartite graph (you enter the number of vertices in the first and second parts)
